# Interconnected_Robot_Network
The Interconnected Robot Network (abbreviated IRN) is a Senior Design project for four students in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NC State University.

We worked on this project from Spring 2022 - Fall 2022.

Team Members: Brandon O, Caleb Wheeler, Tanner Boylan, Clay Scarboro

We are now using this to store MSP432 code as well.
